# File to track our strategic decisions for the project.

# Decision 0001 — Dataset Intake: Our415
Context: Needed time-bound events with SF coverage.
Decision: Adopt for MVP.
Mapping: name,start/end,venue,price,category,lat/lon → events.csv schema.
License: DataSF (cite on README).
Revisit: Quarterly.

# Decision 0002 — Relevance Gate
Only datasets scoring ≥70 on the gate enter the pipeline for MVP.

Score each proposed dataset 0–100. Only ingest if ≥ 70.

Criterion						Points	Pass bar
========================================================================================
Has time-bound events or stable activities with hours	30	Required
Location (lat/lon or address)	    			20	Required
Price or price band					15	Nice-to-have (else infer)
Age restriction (explicit or derivable)			10	Nice-to-have
License allows academic/local use			10	Required
SF coverage + recent (≤12 months or evergreen)		10	Strongly preferred
Machine-readable (CSV/API/ICS)				 5	Preferred

Examples:

Our415 events → ~85 (good).

Eventbrite/Ticketmaster API → 80–90 (good).

City Survey → ~30 (demographics only, no events/prices/hours) → reject for MVP.

Film locations → ~40 (fun, not useful for itineraries) → reject now.

# Decision 0003 - Team Roles

Product / PM — Nhi (scope + acceptance)
* Owns problem statement, personas, success metrics, and milestone scope.
* Maintains backlog, runs standups, writes submissions (proposal/progress/final).
* Decides dataset intake via the Relevance Gate; keeps Decision Log in README.
* Done = sprint goal + DOD written, metrics/UX acceptance checked, submission packaged.

Data — JD (ingest + schema)
* Sources/cleans datasets; enforces licenses; builds events.csv/venues.csv.
* Geocodes, fixes time fields, price bands, age_min; builds data dictionary.
* Versioning (CSV/Parquet) and EDA notebook.
* Done = validated tables (see QC below) + dictionary + EDA pushed.

Modeling — Charley (algorithms + evaluation)
* Implements filters, scoring, greedy itinerary, diversity rules.
* Defines/owns offline metrics (budget/age compliance, diversity, latency; optional P@k).
* Reproducible experiments + unit tests.
* Done = recommend() + build_itinerary() pass tests, metrics reported for 2 personas.

Prototype / MLOps — Carlo (demo + glue)
* Builds Streamlit (or Flask) UI; integrates model; logs latency.
* Exposes simple API wrapper; packaging (environment.yml), README run steps.
* Optional export (CSV/ICS) and screenshots.
* Done = form → ranked list → editable itinerary with budget/time bars; screenshots saved.

# Decision 0004 - Handoffs (contracts)

Data → Model (JD → Charley)
* Files: data/seed/events.csv, data/seed/venues.csv
* Required columns:
	* event_id,name,categories,start_time,end_time,venue_id,min_price,max_price,age_min,lat,lon,neighborhood,source
	* venues.csv: venue_id,name,address,neighborhood,lat,lon,hours
* QC thresholds:
	* ≥300 events; ≤5% nulls on start_time/end_time/lat/lon; age_min filled (default 0 if unknown); prices present or banded.

Model → Prototype (Charley → Carlo)
* Python API:
	def recommend(prefs: dict) -> list[dict]:
	    # returns ranked events with fields: event_id,name,score,start,end,price,age_min,lat,lon,neighborhood,why
	def build_itinerary(events: list[dict], user: dict) -> dict:
	    # returns {items:[{event_id,start,end,travel_min,price}], totals:{time_min, price}}
* Include why explanations (e.g., “category match + close + in budget”) for UI.

PM checkpoints (Nhi)
* Accepts JD’s data only if QC passes and Relevance Gate ≥70.
* Accepts model/UI only if DOD met and metrics printed in report.
