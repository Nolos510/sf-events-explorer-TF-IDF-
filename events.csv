But the truth is, there are a wide variety of possibilities  including watercolor pencils, water soluble crayons and pastels, ink, and  more. The diversity of mark making and the changeable nature of those marks  offer much to explore. This is a process based class that prioritizes  experimentation as a way to let go of perfectionism. Only happy accidents  here!    We will do several quick studies and then use our favorite ideas and  techniques to make a large work on 350 weight cold press paper.

This style of class gives students more    time for drawing and on-the-spot instructions. Please bring a pad of drawing    paper and prefered drawing materials to class. Basic drawing materials will    also be provided. The cost includes a $100 model fee.

This class gives  folks an opportunity to express themselves creatively through art-making and  connecting with their intuition. We will use images of trees and various  other parts of the natural world--which incorporate surprising colors,  textures, and perspectives--for inspiration. We will experiment with elements  and principles of art such as line, shape, and balance, while exploring  intuitive art making. You get to be the orchestrator here.

"40357_rpd","SF Rec Park","Figure Drawing I: Learning by Hand","Figure    drawing is an active process; an engagement with material that is both    physical and intellectual. In this class, students will be encouraged to work    in terms of process rather than making a finished product, in order to foster    curiosity and therefore, insight. Insights will be learned through visual    problem solving, exploring the looking and seeing relationship, and the    expression of touching marker to paper. This class will take full advantage    of its in class time for drawing time, with instruction limited to demos and    corrections. Each class will have a particular focus on the figure and    helpful techniques for rendering. Price of the model is included in the cost    of the class. Please bring paper and drawing materials to class.
